# Generative AI for Music Therapy: A Hands-On Guide

This repository contains the complete outline for the book ***Generative AI for Music Therapy: A Hands-On Guide***, a comprehensive resource on how metadata, computational musicology, physiological sensing, and generative artificial intelligence (e.g., Suno, MusicGen, diffusion models) are reshaping the future of music-based therapeutic practice.

The book is organized into **seven major parts** and **thirty chapters**, moving from theoretical foundations to hands-on AI tools, clinical applications, adaptive systems, ethics, and future research directions.
